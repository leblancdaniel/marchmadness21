A fun project attempting to make a perfect bracket.

Here's the inital plan...  
- Gather a few benchmarks from leaderboards from 2 years ago
- Gather data from 2019 Kaggle competition
- Create REALLY simple model to predict win probability
- Engineer a bunch of new interesting features and use another simple model
- Using the new features, create a more complex model
- Reduce dimensionality (PCA, etc.) and create another model
- Test & compare results on 2019 data
- Collect 2021 data & import into our dataset
- Test old models on 2021 bracket
- Re-train models using 2021 data
- Test new models on 2021 bracket

## Top models from previous competitions


## Data sources


## Simple model


## Feature engineering (and extra data sources)


## Complex model(s)


## Dimensionality Reduction/ Feature Importance


## Compare Results on 2019 data


## Import 2021 data


## Old model results on 2021 bracket


## Re-train models using 2021 data


## New model results on 2021 bracket
